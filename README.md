**About Four Sisters Coffee Co.**

Four Sisters Coffee Co. is an imaginary coffee shop founded by four sisters: Meghan, Mackenzie, Maura, and Maddie. Growing up, we always imagined what it would be like if we started our own business. 

No matter what we were going through, good or bad, there was always one question that bonded us.

**"Wanna Go Get Coffee?"**

**Purpose:**

The idea of this coffee shop originated from a newsletter I made last spring in my Integrating Writing and Design class. I am excited to create this website to showcase my unwavering bond with my sisters and our love for coffee!
