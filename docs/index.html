        <h1>Welcome to Four Sisters Coffee Co.! </h1>

        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Friends come and go, sisters are forever. That could not be any truer for us Conley sisters! Having four girls within only five years between each other seems like a lot for most families, but for us, it is the dream. Since birth, we have been inseparable. Of course, we have our little tiffs here and there, but the love we have for each other is unwavering and sisterhood is a relationship we are lucky to experience. We truly are each other’s cup of coffee. Not too hot, not too cold, but just right. No matter what the occasion, there are four magic words that could cure any heartbreak, fight, or drama in our lives.</p>
        <p>"Wanna Go Get Coffee?" </p>
        <p> Our love for coffee began in 2014 when Meghan turned 16 and started driving. She loved the freedom, and we loved the additional perk of her chauffeuring us around and making a pit stop at Starbucks or Dunkin’ before school. Unfortunately, this turned into an expensive habit. So much so that our parents bought us our very own espresso machine and syrups to make coffee at home. At first, we loathed them for taking away our precious coffee trips, but looking back it started a hidden passion of ours—making coffee. Growing up in Erie, PA, we are no stranger to snow storms. One winter, we got snowed in. To cure our boredom, we started using our coffee machine and acted like we were running a café. We even created a binder to record all our coffee concoctions and recipes. The recipe book continued to be piled with new tips and tricks that we had discovered unintentionally.</p>
        <p> Life went on and we each pursued different passions and occupations.  But we never thought we would claim the title “Business Owners.” While our jobs satisfied us enough, they were quite mundane and tiring. We wanted to do something that made us truly happy. We would always joke to each other about starting our own business. Three of us had a degree in Communication and Marketing while Kenzie is a NICU nurse but has always loved party planning and has an eye for design.</p>
