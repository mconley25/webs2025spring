        <h1>About Us </h1>

        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>Friends come and go, sisters are forever. That could not be any truer for us Conley sisters! Having four girls within only five years between each other seems like a lot for most families, but for us, it's the dream. Since birth, we have been inseparable--we literally do everything together! Of course, we fight--mostly over clothes--but the love we have for each other is unwavering. We are so lucky to have each other in our lives and we cannot wait to celebrate our new endeavor as business partners! </p>
         <p> We truly are each other’s cup of coffee. Not too hot, not too cold, but just right. No matter the occasion, there are four magic words that could cure any heartbreak, fight, or drama in our lives.</p>

        <p>Our love for coffee began in 2014 when our oldest sister--Meghan--turned 16 and started driving. She loved the freedom, and we loved the additional perk of her chauffeuring us around and making a pit stop at our favorite coffee shops. Unfortunately, this turned into an expensive habit--sorry, Dad. So, our parents bought us our very own espresso machine to make coffee at home. At first, we were annoyed that they took away our precious coffee trips. But, looking back, it started a hidden passion of ours--making coffee.</p> 
        <p>Growing up in Erie, PA, we are no strangers to snow storms. In the 2017-2018 season, Erie got 198.5 inches of snow. We were snowed in, so we couldn't visit our favorite coffee shops. To cure our boredom, we started using our coffee machine at home. We acted like we were running a café--Kenzie would take orders, Meghan would run the espresso machine, Maura would fill the cups with ice, and Maddie would serve the coffee. We even created a binder to record all our coffee concoctions and recipes. We rely on this binder to craft all our signature drinks and baked goods in the shop.</p>
        <p> Life went on and we found ourselves following different paths. While our jobs brought us a sense of stability, they were often mundane. We often joked about starting our own business together--and now, our dream is a reality!</p>
