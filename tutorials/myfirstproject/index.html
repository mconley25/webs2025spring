        <h2>What is Bouldering?</h2>
        <p>Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses. </p>
        <p>Unlike traditional climbing, bouldering focuses on short but intensive routes called "problems," typically keeping climbers within a safe distance from the ground while they navigate challenging sequences of moves.</p>

        <div class="teal-bg">
        <p>Experience the perfect blend of <strong>physical challenge and mental puzzle-solving </strong> as you navigate routes close to the ground, with nothing but a crash pad and determination. </p> 
        <p>Bouldering strips climbing down to its purest form, <strong>making it both accessible to beginners and endlessly challenging for experts.</strong></p>
