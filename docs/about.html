        <h1>About Us </h1>

        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>Friends come and go, but sisters are forever. That couldn’t be any truer for us Conley sisters! Having four girls within only five years of each other seems like chaos for most siblings, but for us, it’s the dream. Since birth, we have been inseparable—literally we do everything together. Of course, we fight—mostly over clothes—but the love we have for each other is unwavering. We are so lucky to have each 
            other in our lives and cannot wait to celebrate our new journey of starting our own coffee shop!</p>
         <p> We truly are each other’s cup of coffee. Not too hot, not too cold, but just right. No matter the occasion, there are four magic words that could cure any heartbreak, fight, or drama in our lives: </p>
         <p><em> <strong> "Wanna Go Get Coffee?"</em></strong> </p>

        <p>Our love for coffee began in 2014 when our oldest sister, Meghan, turned 16 and started driving. She loved the freedom, and we loved the additional perk of her chauffeuring us around and making a pit stop at our favorite local coffee shop before school. Unfortunately, this turned into an expensive habit—sorry Dad. So, our parents bought us our very own espresso machine to make coffee at home.</p> 
        <p>Growing up in Erie, PA, we are no strangers to snow storms. In the 2017-2018 season, Erie got 198.5 inches of snow—that’s taller than a coffee tree! We were snowed in, so we couldn't visit our favorite coffee shops. To cure our boredom, we started using our coffee machine at home. We acted like we were running a café; one of us would take orders, another would run the espresso machine, another would fill the cups with ice, and another would serve the coffee. We even created a binder to record all of our coffee concoctions and recipes. We rely on this binder to craft all our signature drinks and baked goods in the shop!</p>
        <p> Life went on and we found ourselves following different paths. While our jobs brought us a sense of stability, they were often mundane. We always joked about starting a business together, but never thought it would actually happen—and now, our dream is a reality!</p>
        <p>What makes this venture even more special is the fact that we get to do it TOGETHER! We share memories only sisters can understand—like the inside jokes that makes us laugh until we cry and the late-night talks about our biggest dreams and fears. Our mission at Four Sisters Coffee Co. is to welcome you to our family and brew beautiful moments with loved ones. </p>
